# Egg, Fox, Feathers v1 (current)
Who: 
What: Using a standard rock, paper, scissors script to make my own egg, fox, feathers game. 
Why: 
    * The Logic:
    ** Rock, Paper, Scissors is a standard game to practice the conditional if/else-if/else using vanilla JS. 
    ** I took an old practice RPS script and changed it to ES6.
    * The Look:
    ** Practice using Flexbox
    ** I added a Gulp file to watch my Sass.
    ** Sketch: This challenge is no different except that for me, creating the SVGs for a rock, paper, and scissors did not interest me in the least, so to embrace the SVG challenge, I needed something else to draw
